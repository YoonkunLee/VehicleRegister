I completed this task with three different projects which are, 

1. VehicleRegister
2. VehicleRegister.Data.MSSQL
3. VehicleRegister.Web

The reason for three parts to follow the Separation of Concerns (SOC) and 
preparation for expansion/change in the future (mentioned in task scope). 

First VehicleRegister project contains only models (data models and view models) and service.
VehicleRegister.Data.MSSQL is represent Data layer that connect with database and allow get/post data.
VehicleRegister.Web is represent Present layer that create UI pages to users and allows interaction with them.
